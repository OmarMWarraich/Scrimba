  ======== Helpers
    - rgba = red, green blue, alpha (alpha being the opacity on a scale of 0 to 1 - 0.5 sounds good?)
    - rgba is complex and it's a bit of a time sink to remember all the values, look at rgba colour values online, or rgba colour convetors, or even colour palettes!
    - if you come from a design background, you'll know you can convert HEX values (e.g. #ffffff to rgba using a convertor)
